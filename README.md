# ChangeRobot
- This ChangeBot is a combination of [CollisionRobot](https://github.com/aytijosei/ChangeRobot/blob/master/src/changeBot/CollisionBotStrategy.java), [EdgingRobot](https://github.com/aytijosei/ChangeRobot/blob/master/src/changeBot/EdgingBotStrategy.java) and [KeyboardRobot](https://github.com/aytijosei/ChangeRobot/blob/master/src/changeBot/KeyboardBotStrategy.java) that I have developed previously.  
- This robot can change its strategy at the push of a button. With ``c`` key, you can swap the strategy of the ChangeBot during operation.

## What is Robocode?
- Robocode is a programming game, where the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java. The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.

- Read [the Introduction](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/docs/ReadMe.html) for Robocode.

## Command Line
- It is possible to specify options and predefined properties from the
command-line when running Robocode. The usage of these can be listed by
writing this from a command prompt or shell:
```
robocode -help
```
